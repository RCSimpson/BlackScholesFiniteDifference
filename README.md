# BlackScholesFiniteDifference
Options are a financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset before or at an expiration date at some time in the near future. 
Generally speaking the underlying asset of an option is one hundred shares of stock. This gives the buyer significant leverage over simply outright buying the hundred shares of stock. 
The Black-Scholes equation is a partial differential equation that gives the fair value of an option given time to expiration and the price of the underlying asset. This 
partial differential equation has a closed solution (for European options), but can still be estimated using compuational techniques. This repository focuses on the use of fintie diffference
schemes to solve the Black-Scholes equation.
